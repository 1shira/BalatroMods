Funny little collection of Balatro mods

navigate to your Balator mods Folder and run
```
git clone https://github.com/1shira/BalatroMods
```

I use branches for different collections, to switch use 
```
git checkout <branch>
```

I've got the Following branches:

main - A lot of random mods thrown together, crashes sometimes
multi - Less mods, more stable, includes the multiplayer mod
none- Empty folder for when you want to play Vanilla
insanity - Cryptid mods, a few decks and extra stakes, includes multiplayer, hasn't crashed on me yet
